##Introduction
Each event will require crafting an agenda (or agendas, depending on scope of the event). It’s important to keep in mind that even the most carefully considered agenda will more than likely have to change during the training. The decisions in the event planning stage will become input parameters in the agenda planning process. The major inputs include:
Participants (number, diversity, roles and competencies)
Venue (size, location, facilities)
Resources available (connectivity, hardware)
Trainers (number, competencies)
Communication prior to and during the event.
Make sure you allot yourself enough time for crafting an agenda as well the preparation that follows. The more days there are for the training workshop, the more prep days you'll need. After choosing a given topic as part of your agenda, each session generally takes about half a day to design, and another half day to source materials, prepare presentations and gather materials. This amounts to approximately one day to prepare each session. A standard 4-day digital security workshop that has about 8 sessions will require 8 days of preparation for a single trainer. (Note that this doesn't include event planning nor overall agenda design.)

##Best Practices and Principles
###1. Pre-training contact and preparation
You should have at least a minimum of contact with participants and the hosting organization (if any) before the training (see Event Planning for additional details). How this is done will vary greatly depending on whether you have the possibility of face-to-face contact with participants. Conducting a pre-event visit is strongly recommended if possible.

Whatever your means of initial contact may be, that is typically the time to introduce yourself (if this is consistent with your own security protocols) and begin to establish a relationship of trust. It's generally best to avoid talk of sensitive issues at this point.

It is always ideal to have a face to face meeting or conduct a site visit if at all possible and safe, especially if you’re training members of a single organization. Moreover, if a face to face meeting is possible prior to the training, it often provides the opportunity to discuss more sensitive topics in depth such as participant selection, or logistics.

Otherwise, trainers have to navigate how to safely communicate and share such information over the available channels of communication, which depends on a wide range of factors and can take a number of approaches. Trainers should always strive to move their contacts towards means of communication that are as secure as possible, given what they know about their contact’s environment and threat model, but always in light of that contact’s comfort and abilities. In these cases, trainers will still often be limited in the amount of information they can glean before a training.

If it is possible to do so securely, it is also ideal to be transparent with participants regarding aspects of yourself and/or your work which may be of note to them and what is realistic to expect from you (for example, in terms of technical support). It is also important to be clear about the source of funding for the event, particularly if there is an “information retention policy” pertaining to the event (e.g., does the funder demand any information about participants? If so, what?) This is best dealt with while participants still have a choice to opt out of the training. If there is an intermediary organisation organising the training and which will be dealing with this information, it may be wise to prompt them to make such information clear to potential participants when they are invited.

Whether you’re able to meet face-to-face or only communicate at a distance, some good initial points to establish which will help you to initially sketch the agenda are:
The operating systems used by participants
Their general computing habits: programs/applications and online services used at work and in free time
Computer hygiene: do participants have anti-malware software installed, and which?
Basic computer skills: do participants have the ability to install programs on their computers?
If its possible to gather and communicate this information safely: Has there been any recent incidents that the trainer should know about (e.g., accounts compromised, spearphishing attacks, raids, etc.)?
You may gather this information from a primary contact who gathers it on your behalf, or you may even have the time and access to start a mailing list of participants before you arrive. If you are able to safely conduct a survey directly or by proxy, this can be a great way to get initial information directly from your participants.
You may gather this information from a primary contact who gathers it on your behalf, or you may even have the time and access to gather more via a pre-training mailing list of participants before you arrive. If you are able to safely conduct a survey directly or by proxy, this can be a great way to get initial information directly from your participants (as well as from an organization if you’re providing a training for participants from the same organzation). If you're also able to conduct pre-event interviews with par

Keep in Mind: Even if you are able to communicate safely with plenty of lead time, the information you gather at this point is useful, but still only informs an initial snapshot of your participants’ skills, needs, environment, and concerns. Some of this is due to typical barriers of communication, but some of this is due to self-reporting biases by either your primary contact or the participants in general. The agenda based on this initial content gathered is almost always just a draft that will be adjusted based on what you observe during the first hours in the classroom.

###2. The participant-driven agenda
While there are certain minimums that should be observed in order for the training to be successful, participants should be given as much control of the agenda as possible. This is consistent with the notion of empowering human rights defenders and marginalised communities and establishing as 'horizontal' (rather than vertical) a learning space as possible.

Furthermore, it is consistent with the notion that whatever capacities we intend to build in response to a perceived risk situation – in this case, the risk of information or information systems being compromised, leading to threats or attacks to the physical or psychological integrity of the participants or their communities – should correspond to an analysis of this risk situation, i.e. they need to learn what is appropriate for them to feel and be safe, nothing more.

Therefore, it's advisable to emphasise the point and give participants the tools necessary to define the agenda to the greatest extent possible. If you have time to prepare before the training, when collecting input for the first draft of your agenda, keep in mind that you probably don’t have all the information you need - so it's advisable to carry out further exercises on Day 1 to complement whatever information you've gathered. No amount of preparation guarantees you a training without hiccups, so remember to be flexible and responsive to the needs of your participants (see below).

###3. Non-negotiables
While it's important to give a certain amount of control of the agenda to participants, you may feel that there are certain topics which are 'non-negotiables' for inclusion on the agenda which if neglected would undermine the usefulness of covering other topics - for example, covering malware, antivirus or passwords. If this is the case, it is a good idea to be clear about this with participants before carrying out an expectation check.

Some participants may have already learned these fundamentals - but it’s important to ensure that this is the case and do not simply assume it to be so. Additionally, recognize that participants will inevitably be at different skill levels: if it’s at all possible, consider additional training for beginners, or starting them early. Failing this, you may have to split the group during the training, provided there is a co-facilitator to help with this.

###4. Managing participant energy and control of working hours
It's worth always bearing in mind that the participants in your training, depending on where they are coming from and the work they do, may be subject to great stress and possibly trauma on a regular basis. In some cases, a digital security training takes them out of their usual context and possibly into more relaxing social, cultural, aesthetic (etc.) surroundings, which could potentially be of great benefit to them. While a digital security training should have clear objectives from a digital security perspective, it's important to take account of the general well-being of participants, a positive impact upon which is our ultimate goal.

Given this, it's a good idea to open up the working hours of the training for discussion among participants, given that they may need time for physical or mental rest, exercise, networking and so on. However, it should be made clear the impact that shorter working hours will have on the objectives of the training, i.e. if they request shorter working hours, you may not be able to cover everything they hoped to cover. Furthermore, don't neglect your own well-being and agree to working 12 hour days if you don't feel you are able for it!

One way to develop shared ground rules and expectations may be to have long lunches and end/start early, but invite participants to commit to being "fully present" during training sessions.

###5. Setting up and creating a safe space
“Setting up” and creating a safe space are important “Day 1” activities and can be achieved in a number of ways. Their aim is for participants to be introduced to one another to the extent possible, and for an atmosphere of trust, respect and safety to be established which will allow for a productive and responsible training. As mentioned above, participants may be suffering from very high levels of stress. In addition, they may not be familiar with the other participants, so establishing trust with their fellow trainees may be a crucial goal that's part of creating and nurturing a 'safe place' for the training. Given this context, the importance of creating a relaxing yet productive, and above all safe, space for trainees shouldn't be understated.

Please Note: Although funders and other interested individuals may ask to "watch" or "stop by" an event, this should be not allowed unless a) they are known by everyone in the room, who have agreed to their presence, b) they are going to participate in the entire training and the participants have agreed to this after being fully informed who they are and what their role is vis-a-vis the training. Otherwise, having non-participating individuals in the room is disruptive, will interfere with the training, and is likely to make participants feel uncomfortable and less open, and in worst case scenarios, endanger the training as a whole. This is not conducive to creating a safe space—especially for high risk or traumatized participants. Trainers should handle this carefully yet firmly, and prioritize it as a requirement to communicate to organizers and funders.

Key agenda elements in this regard include:

Introductions: There are many ways to get participants to introduce themselves or one another to the group, such as through interviews in pairs, brief introductions in the opening circle, etc. It may be useful to emphasise that participants don't have to use their real names if they don't wish to.


Guidelines & agreements: It's an important practice to establish the minimum 'ground rules' for the training early and leave the list open for additions. This can be combined with the introduction exercise, though participants may wish to make their requests to the group with regard to security, privacy, courtesy etc. in a more 'anonymous' manner (for example, through an exercise with stickies). The Chatham House Rule is often a popular option to suggest as an optional policy for participants.


Social media: Some participants may wish to take pictures, tweet and update their other social network accounts at the training, while this may make others (for good reason) deeply uncomfortable. It’s very important to specifically discuss how if at all the event should be recorded and what should be shared externally. Until clear rules are established and given consensus by the group, the default should an embargo on photos and references to the event or its participants in social media, email etc.

(If you have any issues downloading individual exercises, we suggest downloading the entire manual here.)  

###6. Managing expectations
It is important to recognise that what your intervention can achieve, no matter how long or well-resourced, is finite. You will never be able to cover everything that is needed or requested by participants or the organisation who may be hosting your training, and it is important to be clear with participants about the limitations to the training.

Although it may be frustrating, it's also important to remember that it is best to cover few items properly than to try to cover too many items quickly and poorly, especially when it comes to more complex items such as email encryption. Trying to cover too much in too little time may overwhelm your audience and they are unlikely to retain much from the training. They are also likely to gain a poor impression of privacy and security tools as being too difficult to use or implement.

###7. Sequencing
It's a good idea to take into account how certain topics "fit" together (or don't) when designing a draft agenda or adjusting it: ideally, topics will build upon each other so that participants can use easier tools first, which complement more difficult tools later. An example is covering how to create and maintain strong passwords before moving on to tools such as encryption which require participants to create new, strong passwords.

###8. Flexibility and change
The agenda planning process should be viewed as dynamic. While it is essential to have a draft/skeleton agenda prepared prior to the start of the event, it is equally important to remember:
to convene the trainers/facilitators and organizers prior to the event to complete and confirm the agenda
to be prepared for substantial deviations to the agenda in the course of the program.
be careful not to make the event too unstructured or cause participants to feel that it’s become chaotic. It's good to revisit the agenda at the start and end of each day, to discuss progress and possible changes with participants.

###9. Hands-off vs. hands-on
All of the above notwithstanding, the most time-consuming part of a digital security training are the hands-on sessions with tools. While awareness-raising has value, increasing the implementation of a tool or a practice requires hands-on sessions, which require more time. This is especially true of more challenging tools such as TrueCrypt or GPG.

###10. Regular evaluation and feedback
It's a good practice to carry out an evaluation at the end of each day where participants can establish what they liked about the day (and would like to see more of) -- "pluses" --, and which elements they would like to change (rather than "what they didn't like") -- "deltas." These can be gathered in a number of ways including (but not limited to):
Giving each participant two cards or post-its of different colors (one for plusses and one for deltas) to write on and hand in.
Leaving large “plus” and “delta” flipchart sheets open to be filled in by participants at the end of the day.
Using 'base groups' throughout the training to discuss with one another what they liked and disliked at the end of each day, and getting them to provide their feedback on cards, on flipchart paper or through delegating someone to report back each evening.
It’s a good practice to take a moment at the beginning of each day to respond to the pluses and particularly deltas identified by participants at the end of the previous day. It’s a good idea to highlight openly the aspects that the group felt was going well, and respond to reasonable and/or widely-shared deltas which you have the ability to change (and be clear about those which you don’t have the power to change).

##Agenda Components
Starting and ending sessions
  - Each day should have opening and closing sessions including, for example, an energizer and a go-around of how participants are feeling or what they are thinking at the start/end of the day.
Establishing expectations
  - This is a 'must' exercise for the first day.
Guidelines and Ground Rules
  - This is a 'must’ exercise for the first day.
Times and Places
  - Clearly outlining the training locations, start and end times, outing schedule and and evening hours (if any). This should be included on the first day, and be clear throughout the training for participants.
The Content
  - This includes the training sessions you’ve chosen in order to cover the topics, issues, and skills you’ve identified as priorities.
  - This is likely to change, particularly after the first day, as you gain a greater sense of the participants in the room and what the most effective sessions will be for them as a group given any wide variations in skills and experiences. Trainers are likely to begin to adjust the draft agenda (sometimes very substantially) based on the first day, and should budget enough time after the end of the first day to meet up and discuss if and how the agenda should be adjusted.
Energisers and Icebreakers
  - Trainers will want to spread these throughout the training in order to a) “break the ice” among participants in the early days, and b) break up the sessions with fun activities. Trainers are likely to be conservative in their choices of energizers/icebreakers in the early days of the event; after a few days, you’ll know your participants better and know if there’s any type of energizers/icebreakers to avoid due to physical (e.g., high mobility energizers for less-mobile participants) or wellbeing issues (e.g., energizers/icebreakers that involve touching).
Roles
 - The roles of everyone directly involved in the training, including trainers, co-trainers, supporting staff, organizations, and participants should be clear amongst those running the training, as well as the participants. Introduce everyone who will be in the room on the first day if this hasn't already happened before the event.
 -  Although funders and other individuals may ask to "watch" or "stop by" an event, this should be not allowed unless a) they are known by everyone in the room, who have agreed to their presence, b) they are going to participate in the entire training and the particpants have agreed to this after being fully informed who they are and what their role is vis-a-vis the training. Otherwise, having non-participating individuals in the room is disruptive and will interfere with the training, will make participants feel uncomfortable and likely less open, and in worst case scnearios, endanger the training as a whole.
Trainer Schedule, which is is twofold:
  - The schedule of how the trainers and co-trainers will lead, co-lead and/or support various sessions. Given how much energy it takes to be the main trainer, it’s advisable to trade off leading sessions when you have qualified co-trainers. Be careful to pace yourself so you don’t burn out during the training.
  - There is great utility in having trainers offer “open office hours” for participants during multi-day trainings in order to give participants opportunities for 1:1 (or small group) assistance. These are useful for “parking lot” concerns that come up during a training that aren’t directly relevant to the entire group, and particularly for complex issues (e.g., malware removal). Depending on the training schedule, these can be held either during the second half of a long lunch period, after the main training day has ended, or during any “off” periods during the training.
Contingency plans
  - Logistics: Do you have a back-up plan if one of your main resources aren’t available or go out (like electricity, connectivity, etc.)?
  - Operational Security: Have plans in place in case the training becomes unsafe in some way, especially if you are providing a training for high-risk participants or in a risky context.
Daily evaluation
  - Daily pluses and deltas, as described above under #10.Trainers should meet briefly at the end of every day to go over participants’ plusses and deltas and tweak the event and agenda as need be (within reason), in order to continually improve the training as it continues.
  - At the beginning of the subsequent day’s training with participants, trainers should take a short period of time to review the plus highlights, and then bring up any deltas that are broadly shared and address them.

##Common Pitfalls
You must be careful to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach to digital security trainings, i.e. arriving with a standard, pre-set agenda. In the best-case scenario, this may leave some participants feeling disempowered or 'spoken down' to. In the worst case scenario, you could teach people to use software which is illegal or dangerous to use in their context.
Don’t make your content too advanced. If your audience's level is basic and their main concerns are still basic computer hygiene and information management, stay there with them. Don’t just jump into TrueCrypt if half your audience has devices that are badly infected with malware.

While it is understandable that, before the training, you may want to gather as much information as is possible from participants to aid your preparation, you should always be careful to check whether the information you may wish to gather would be considered sensitive by the participants and they would rather not share it over an insecure channel (i.e. unencrypted email).

##Additional Resources
P2PU has a course full of resources on Designing Collaborative Workshops, many of which come from other organizations like Aspiration Tech, The Ruckus Society, and Seeds for Change.
Aspiration Tech has a Facilitation Wiki with relevant sections for security workshops.
Seeds for Change has a number of resources, including those focused on facilitation and faciliation tools.

Although Tactical Technology Collective's Source Camps are a larger type of event than most security workshops, their resources on faciliation and agendas are useful.
