##Learning Goals
- learn the basics of mobile telephony and how mobile networks function
- understand the implications of mobile telephony infrastructure for information and personal security
- learn how to mitigate the vulnerabilities of feature phones

####Materials to Prepare
- Make sure you have a big enough space for the activity where participants can spread out and see each other. Ensure you don't have anything that can block visibility (e.g., pillars).
- Flipchart or whiteboard with markers.
- Optional projector and images of mobile network towers.

####Running the Activity

#####Introduction
(Images are optional in the following brief Q&A and Introduction to the Activity). Ask if anyone has seen and can describe what a mobile network tower looks like. Expand from their answer to describe (and optionally show) that what we commonly call "towers" can indeed look like towers, but can also involve different types of hardware that work together to provide the service we think of when we say our mobile devices communicate with the network via "towers." The hardware of mobile network "towers" that our devices communicate with can present as panels, antennas and small dishes on buildings and other structures, especially in urban environments. Some of them are only pointed in one direction, and others can receive and send signals 360 degrees. Mention that you'll be calling them "towers" for the sake of simplicity, but you wanted to explain that they are made of different types of hardware and may not look like towers.

#####Activity
Ask for a volunteer to be your mobile phone moving through the mobile network. Then ask for three more volunteers to be "cell phone towers," and ask them to stand at different points around the cell phone, with some being closer and farther away.

**Optional additional framing:** Ask participants what it was like when they first saw a cell phone. They thought it was amazing, right? They didn't have to go to a physical location to use a phone, or wait for a call. They could go anywhere, and the phone was right with them. Remind them how our calls go through quite quickly, especially if they are local (vs. international) calls. Even international calls are amazing, even though we take them for granted: Someone in New Zealand (or choose somewhere remote and far away), can dial my number on their cell phone, and my phone will being to ring in a matter of seconds after they've dialed, or requested a connection to my phone, which is associated with my phone number. Remind coast-to-coast calls via land lines in large countries used to take several minutes to set up with the assistance of operators, and that people would make the request to the operator on the phone, and then wait quite a while for the call to be "put through" before they finally got through to the number they'd requested.

We take this almost magical, comparatively immediate access and service for granted, and the recent growing awareness that mobile network providers can also see a LOT of information about us via our cell phones makes many people nervous. But we need to remember the reason why mobile network operators can do this. It's because the network needs to constantly be in communication with our mobile devices in order to know where we are in order to direct calls and text messages intended for us to us as quickly and as efficiency as possible. Ask: Why would that then keep track of that information? Answer: So they can bill us.

**First:** Explain that is a very simplified version of how our devices "talk" to the mobile network, but the principle is the same. Explain that our phones are constantly communicating to the mobile network that is closest to it. To illustrate this, the person in role of the cell phone will ask "Where am I?" In response, the closest person in the role of a tower will say "Marco," the second closest will say "Polo," and the third closest will say either "was a famous adventurer," or "was a very important historical figure," or "an travelling man" (the first two are more fun as tongue twisters, but if you're working with a group who are less comfortable with the language of the training, make this third response as short as possible. Ask the participants to demonstrate from where they're standing, with the "cell phone" standing somewhere in the middle of the "towers." Have them do it more than once if necessary.

**Urban Network:** Now have more towers come stand near by the first cluster of towers (approximately half to two-thirds of the participants if you can). Then mention that sometimes we stay in one place, but most of the time, we're on the move, and so the mobile network needs to stay in contact with us so it knows where we are in case it needs to route a call or a text message to or from us. Have the cell phone participant start at one side of the cluster of mobile towers, and walk in until s/he has a few towers around her, then have her start and ask "Where am I?" than have the closet towers respond. If two towers are equidistant, allow them to say "Marco" together, then the next closest say "Polo," and so forth. Have the cell phone participant walk even further through the group and stop a few more times to ask "Where am I?" until she's through the group of towers.

Congratulate them on helping the cell phone participant stay in touch with her network, while also "triangulating" her approximate location for the network, which lets them know (and log) approximately where she is, even if her phone does not have GPS.

**Shift from Urban to Rural:** Now ask the entire group where they've experienced strong signal (or "bars") versus weak signal for their mobile devices. Expand from their answer to describe how how mobile network operators (MNOs) spend money to provide more infrastructure in more populated areas than rural areas due to the greater density of customers, so there tends to be more "towers" in urban environments than rural environments. The other challenge in rural environments is providing service over large areas of land where there may only be a few mobile customers. Explain that the demonstration they just saw was more akin to a denser, more urban environment, but let's demonstrate what the rural experience would look like as well.

**Rural network:** Tell participants that this was an example of an "urban" environment, but we also experience rural environments, where towers can be further apart, and provide "weaker" service. Now have the rest (the final fouth of the group) of the participants who have not been part of the demonstration yet choose a cell phone, and have them spread out in the other half of the room, where the number of towers is fewer and sparser. Now have that cell phone participant do the same thing as the previous, where s/he walks through the "rural network" and asks "Where am I?'

To close, mention to participants that mobile phones ask a more complex digital version of "Where am I?" to the networks around them approximately every three seconds. (That's a lot of communication with the local network!)

####Discussion
- What did they think of the activity?
- Did it match their understanding of how our mobile devices communicate with the network, or was it different?
- Did they understand how the triangulation of a rough location of the phone works with at least three or more points?
- Explain that with more "towers" in contact with the mobile phone, they have even more accuracy to pinpoint its location, which becomes even more detailed if the towers are closer to the phone, which is typically in urban environments.

####Materials to Prepare

- Whiteboard or flipchart and markers
- Projector for videos or images, as well as having those prepared for the session
- Any physical examples of a mobile device that you can offer, whether that's you own mobile phone, or broken out pieces of a phone or other type of mobile device. If you also have an example of a mobile data dongle that you can use to demonstrate the SIM and IMEI of the hardware.

####1. What’s a phone made of?
These are detailed notes to lead a brief introduction or discussion about the components of a mobile phone. The number of components you choose mention will depend on your time available, the enthusiasm of your participants to share and point out various components, and if there’s any particular components you want to focus on as a trainer (e.g., if you are training for video collection and uploading, you may want to spend more time on cameras, mics, and removable media). **We recommend that you at least mention the antenna, battery, SIM, baseband, removable media, and cameras, if present.**

Phones are remarkably complex devices. There are also many other devices enabled to work on mobile networks as well that may not be phones, such as tablets and USB dongles for accessing mobile data on a computer.

Although some phones, particularly smartphones, have much more advanced capabilities, all phones share several core components:

**Antenna:** Antennas may be visible on older devices, with some significantly older models requiring manual telescoping (being pulled in or out by the user). Most newer phones have the antennas built into the body of the phone so they are no longer “visible.” Aside from the antenna responsible for communicating with the mobile network, there may also be antennas for wifi; some manufacturers combine these functionalities into one antenna.

**Battery:** In most phones, batteries are easy to remove. In some newer smartphones (notably iPhones), batteries are not designed for removal and can be hard to access. Removable batteries are preferable for users who use tactics to increase their security.

**Baseband microprocessor:** This is the part of the phone that manages the communications of the phone, including the communications/commands from the user to the phone and from the phone to and from the mobile network. The baseband of a phone is usually considered highly proprietary by manufacturers and can be considered a “black box” in terms of technology. The "E-911" capability of mobile networks to be able to turn on a phone, identify its location, listen via it's microphone, and download data from the device is tied to the baseband on a device. Why? Because many countries require that mobile devices have this capability built in since 9/11. So now, almost all mobile devices can be "enabled" this way without the authorization of the user via mobile networks. The only way to prevent this as the owner of a device is to completely remove the battery. This is why the "black box" proprietary nature of basebands is an important characteristic of contemporary mobile devices.

**SIM and SIM slot/interface:** This is where your SIM card is stored in your phone. There is a limited capacity for data storage on your SIM card, and some users can decide whether or not they want to save certain data to their SIM, internal phone memory, or to removable media. Some phones are designed to manage two SIM cards. If participants may be exposed to this, mention that some phones on non-GSM networks (usually CDMA) do not have SIM cards. If they start asking more detailed questions about SIMs, table them until you cover SIMs more in depth below.

**Removable media (if present):** Removable media includes micro-SD cards. Some phones also have infrared (IR) ports for “beaming” data from one phone to another, as well as Bluetooth.

**Cameras (if present):** Most phones now have cameras that can take pictures and/or video.

####Optional components to mention:
**Circuit board and chips:** What this consists of and looks like will vary depending on the phone. There are chips for translating analog/digital signals, ROM, flash memory chips that store data and the phone’s operating system, microprocessors to process data (such as data sent via Bluetooth), and components that manage the power and charging of the phone.

**Screen:** Screens will range in size and type. Some screens will be monochromatic (black on a single color background) while others can display a wide range of colors. Most monochromatic older phones are LCDs (liquid crystal displays), but there is now a wider variety of screen types as phones are able to display more graphics and colors. Touchscreens are increasingly available on high and mid-range phones.

**Keypad:** Keypads can range from the limited, twelve-button numerical layout common on early handsets, to a full keyboard for smartphones and Blackberries, or an integrated keypad/screen common on touchscreen phones (also known as a ‘soft keyboard,’ from its use of software to display and receive input).

**Ports:** Port are usually for headphone jacks, mini-USB connectivity to a computer, and/or a power charger.

**Microphone:** Microphones are acoustic to electronic input recorders, that translate sounds into data for transmission over the network. Microphones on mobile phones are primarily for capturing voice for use in calling, but may also be used to record audio for documentation or other purposes.

**Speaker:** Speakers are the inverse of microphones.

####2. Your Identity on the Mobile Network
**The IMEI number:** the international mobile equipment identity number, which uniquely identifies the hardware of your mobile device (this is usually a handset, but can also include other mobile devices, such as a wireless modem).

**The IMSI number:** the international mobile subscriber identity number, which uniquely identifies the SIM card. This is tied to a user’s account and phone number.

**Registered SIM:** A registered SIM requires users to provide identification for activation. In Nigeria, for instance, this includes fingerprints and photos, as well as proof of address. All contract SIMs are effectively registered SIMs, because the MNO has a record of your identity, billing address, and more.

**Unregistered SIMs:** In some countries, registration with personal identification is not required to purchase a pay-as-you go SIM. In others, unregistered SIMs are sold on the black market. Recognize that SIMs given to you by another person (colleague, family member, acquaintance, or stranger) may still be registered, just not to you. They could, depending on the degree of separation between you and the person giving you the SIM, be tied back to you via human networks, or by your behavior with the device if they know your typical "patterns of use."

**The TMSI number:** the temporary mobile subscriber identity number, a temporary number that is re-assigned regularly according to location or coverage to help manage roaming and other services. (Primarily relevant for mobile network management.)

####What the mobile network sees
The **network cell** in which the phone is located. A network cells is a defined geographic area that can cover any area from a few meters to several kilometers. Individual cells are served by at least one, if not more, transceivers, and are demarcated from neighboring cells by the use of distinct frequencies. Cells are generally larger in rural areas, smaller in urban areas, and even very small cells in buildings that use a repeaters to improve service signals in the immediate area.

The **location** of the subscriber within that cell. This is determined by triangulating the signal from nearby towers. Again, location accuracy depends on the size of the cell - the more towers in the area, the more accurate the positioning.

**Usage data (or metadata):** The MNO logs records the ‘metadata’ around your content: all your calls (both who you call and who you receive calls from), your sending and receiving of SMS and MMS, your data usage, as well as the exact time and approximate location of all mobile access and usage. All of these pieces of data can identify you individually or in aggregate with others. Even accessing data using encryption (e.g., using HTTPS to access a website), which cannot be “seen” at the MNO level, is tagged with the time and location where you accessed it, even if the content is not known.

**Logging:** The logging of the type, length, and times of service usage such as calling, texting, or web browsing is tagged with your uniquely identifying information and your location at the time. This is all tied to the record the MNO has associated with your registration, which is the information you provided when accessing services (such as buying a SIM or a handset). The length that MNOs keep these logs can vary from country to country depending on the legal requirements on MNOs by the government. They can also vary between MNOs in a country, as some MNOs will keep logs for the legally minimum length of time, while others may choose to keep them longer than they are legally required to. In the US, [this ranged from 6 months to a year](http://gizmodo.com/5845137/which-telecoms-store-your-data-the-longest-secret-memo-tells-all) for MNOs in 2011, but can vary widely and is often not publicly known in most countries. (This is just MNO's keeping logs: This does not include anyone else who is accessing and storing their logs at any point.)

> Show participants Die Zeit's visualization of Malte Spitze's mobile data use over six months, which he requested from his MNO. Describe what the visualization is showing so participants can follow along (including "connecting with network cells as he physically moves around, and the icons denoting calls, SMS, and data usage).

**Content:** The MNO (and/or relevant law enforcement agencies via MNOs or by using other devices called "IMSI Catchers") is technically capable of intercepting and recording calls as well as recording all information you send and received via SMS and MMS, both of which cross the network in the clear as ‘plaintext’. The MNO (and/or relevant law enforcement agencies) is also technically capable of ‘inspecting’ unencrypted data usage, including the content of search engine queries, unencrypted logins to various services, and browsing behavior.

This content data can be cross-referenced against usage and user metadata to provide a comprehensive picture of the frequency, scope, and patterns of of your mobile use. In addition, our behavior can "fingerprint" us as unique, even if a MNO doesn't have any identifying information about us, because [our behavior tends to be unique](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-21923360).

> If you think we can't be distinguished by our usage, think again: A 2012 study of 1.5 million mobile users over 15 months found that with hourly samples taken of our location and usage, 95% of users can be uniquely distinguished using only four data points of usage. ["Unique in the Crowd: The privacy bounds of human mobility"](http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130325/srep01376/full/srep01376.html) This means that our behavior unique identifies us, even if our identity is not tied to the device and its identifying information on a mobile network.

####For an audience with smartphones:
Since smartphones offer even more functionalities and options than feature phones, the amount of information that can be observed and logged is far greater. And in addition, smartphone users are sharing that very detailed identifying information about themselves and their usage to far more companies than just their MNO: every app you choose to install can also send selected data about your usage, call times, contacts, and data use to whomever makes that app. What the app can see and log is often set by the app designer, but there are very few laws and regulations constraining what they can design their app for.

**Android vs. iPhone—some similarities and differences:**
Android devices also share a massive amount of user data with Google, since their OS is deeply entwined with a user's Google account. If you use Google services and apps as well as Android, Google knows an overwhelming amount of information about you -- possibly more than you'd realize about yourself, since they log and analyze that data.

Similarly, iPhones (using iOS as their operating system) provide a similar amount of information about users to Apple, which can be combined with a user's data if they use other Apple products and services. In addition, iPhone and Apple are highly proprietary and closed about their software and hardware, which includes the iPhone itself, as well as the Apple apps that run on it. In comparison, Android is open source, which allows everyone to review their code and know what the Android does.

Android is designed to download apps from the Play Store, which gives users a generic list of they type of access any third-party app from the Play Store can have when you install it on your device, ranging from everything you do to almost nothing. In iPhone's App Store, this is not the case, and users do not know what third-party apps can access on their iPhone with any level of detail upon app download. In addition, the full-disk encryption on iPhones are designed to work for all built-in Apple iPhone apps, but may not work for third-party apps, although the designers of third-party apps can design their apps to work with the iPhone's built-in disk encryption (also called "data protection.") Because of this, iPhone users do not know what third-party apps access on their device regarding their usage of their phone, nor do they know if the data generated or associated with third-party apps downloaded from Apple's App Store is encrypted on their smartphone, which makes it easier to access physically on the device.

Location Information: Smartphones are able to use GPS in addition to the approximate location triangulation of mobile network towers can provide. This gives far more detailed location data to MNOs, as well as to any apps who have access to that information on a smartphone. This more precise locaiton information can also be attached (along with the date and other information) to any pieces of data that the phone collects to post online or store (like a Tweet, a photo, or a recording).

##Background
- This subtopic covers the fundamentals of all mobile phones and devices for when a trainer is leading a training for participants who do *not* have smartphones. It shares ADIDS elements with smartphones, but does not go in depth on smartphone-specific concerns and apps.
- Arriving at a training to discover that the participants all use feature phones (instead of smart phones) is a surprise to try and avoid. In your pre-training interviews or survey, or in your conversations with your main contact, make sure to ask: a) what kind of phone participants use (and its operating system if it's a smart phone); b) what they typically use their phone for (work communications, data collection at work, personal life, etc.); and c) the apps they use on it the most.
- Most trainers don't use or haven't used a feature phone (also commonly called a "dumb phone") for a while. If you're going to lead a training for participants who use feature phones, consider switching to a feature phone for a while to re-familiarize yourself with the experience, see what apps are available, and update yourself generally on the current vulnerabilities and concerns for feature phone users.
- If you have a mixed group of feature phone and smartphone users, consider how you can meet their needs without making anyone feel left out. Be aware that this may also be a very sensitive social issue (are the smartphone owners wealthier, of a different social class, or have more senior positions in an organization?) If you choose to train on smartphone-specific elements (e.g., privacy/security apps), consider splitting the group and having a co-trainer lead a parallel training for feature phone users on a relevant high-priority topic. This could be something you haven't been able to dive into with the group as a whole (like the hardware of a phone), a feature phone app or tool they use heavily in their work, a tailored session focused on a particular element of security that wasn't covered for the group as a whole, or a brainstorming session on how they can use mobiles safely in a project they're considering or working on.

##Notes
Most of the definitions in "Mobile Devices: How do they Work?" are from or adapted from StoryMaker lesson content (Small World News, The Guardian Project, and Free Press Unlimited), which drew from the now defunct SaferMobile Project (copies of some of that material can be found here) and Tibet Action Institute.
