Ask participants if they have questions before completing the session.

**To encourage discussion, you may wish to ask general questions about the material, including:**

- What feature did you like most about Tails?
- What feature did you like least? Was there one that just didn’t seem useful for your situation?
- Was there a feature that you wished it had?
- Would you recommend Tails to colleague or friend?
- If we have a chance to stay in touch with one another after this class, do you think we should do so through Tails?

You may also wish to ask specific questions to make sure some concepts are clearly understood.

**Some examples that may help include:**

- When I first install Tails, can I save documents to it?
- What do I need to do before I can save files or settings?
- What are the ways I can use Tails to access and store sensitive materials?
- Tor helps to encrypt my Internet connection. If I use Pidgin to chat, does that mean that the text I write in the chat is automatically encrypted from my PC to my friend’s PC? What else do I need for that? **(Answer: OTR)**
- Similarly, what do I need to encrypt the text in an email? **(Answer: GPG)**
- Does MAT erase the name of a document?
