summary: "LevelUp's Trainer's Curriculum is a module-based collection of training sessions, field-tested and documented by a growing number of fellow digital security trainers, and gathered here to share with the wider global network of trainers.

For those who support others with training on digital security, the audiences and learners we engage with the most consistently are most often adults. An open and participatory dynamic sets the tone for a training space that is more conducive to learning in general, and specifically to adult learning.

The session modules within the LevelUp curriculum are designed to support just such an environment for your events. Currently, they address some of the most commonly trained upon digital safety habits, practices, and tools, but will continue to grow as more and more trainers share their experience."
