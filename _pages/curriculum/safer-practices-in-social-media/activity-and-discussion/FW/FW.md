summary: "This activity will help illustrate which kinds of information participants may not want to share on social media, and their inability to control information once it's been posted and reused by someone else. Shared information might be altered by others in uncontrollable ways, and that those who receive the information you share may be untrustworthy."

duration: 20-30 minutes

## Materials to Prepare ##

- Index cards and pens

- **Suggested:** Since there's a substantial lag while the participant who creates the message writes it out and addresses it to three people, you can ask them to write them out and give the trainer the names of three recipients before the session starts.

## Running the Activity ##

- Select one participant who should come up with a unique message that is funny or outrageous, but not to share it.

- Ask them to write the message on one side of three cards, leaving the other side of the cards blank.

- Ask them to also think of three participants that they want to message to go to.

- The participant will give the cards to the trainer and tell the trainer the names of the three participants without sharing them with the entire group.

- The Trainer will secretly write "share this with one other person nearby after reading" on one of the cards, or they can tell one of the participants secretly when they hand them the card.

- The trainer explains to the group that they are representing Facebook and will deliver the messages to the three people chosen by the author.

- The trainer delivers 3 cards to the three participants.

- The participants read the message, and one of them shares the message with a neighbor.

- After the messages have been delivered and read, the trainer asks: "who knows what the message said?"

- Four trainees will raise their hand.

## Leading the Discussion ##

When the participant is (hopefully!) surprised, the trainer will ask who the messages were originally meant to go to.

**Ask the fourth recipient to explain how they go the message.**

*You can ask the following questions of the trainees:*

- What kind of control do you have when you share information online?

- Do privacy settings help? In which ways can they help? In which ways can they not help?

- Has anyone ever posted or shared something online that they didn't mean to share?

- If so, how did they deal with it?


## Materials to Prepare ##

- 1 business card (or basic identifying information) from a willing participant.
- **Alternatively:** Give the class a card with a name and an email address.
- Internet connection robust enough for all participants to be able to browse online simultaneously.
- A whiteboard or flipchart board and markers.


## Running the Activity ##

### Introduction: ###

15 minutes of fame is short-lived media publicity or celebrity of an individual or phenomenon. The expression was coined by Andy Warhol, who said in 1968 that “In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.”

The phenomenon is often used in reference to figures in the entertainment industry or other areas of popular culture, such as reality television and YouTube.

### Instructions: ###

- Introduce the volunteer for "15 minutes of fame" and provide only their name and email address.

- Group the trainees into small groups between 2-6 people each.

- Tell the groups they have 15 minutes to research the volunteer using any resource on the Internet using just the person’s name and email address.

- After 15 minutes have passed, have the groups stop researching.

- Go around the groups and ask for the juiciest details about the volunteer.

- Write up the details solicited from the groups on the whiteboard / flipchart.

- **Optional:** If the volunteer is in the room, or known well enough by one of the trainers, extend the competitiveness of the activity by rating the accuracy of the information found by the small groups.

- *Declare a winner!* (Based on who had the most information).

- Ask the different participants what they thought about the process; how they felt about searching for information.

- Ask the volunteer how it felt to have this information searched and found by these strangers.

- Go back to the participants and ask them to note where the information they found came from

## Leading the Discussion ##

Going from the end of the activity, and the questions asked to participants, segue directly into leading the discussion.

**Discuss how easy it can be to find information online** - ask the group to share examples of information sources they used:

- Was there any false information?

- Was there any ambiguous information?

- How can we protect ourselves from having too much information available about us on the internet?

- If someone wanted to find out information about you, who would they need to ask to get it?
