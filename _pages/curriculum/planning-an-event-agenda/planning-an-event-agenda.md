title: Planning An Event Agenda
author: Daniel O'Clunaigh, Carol, Ali Ravi, Lindsay Beck, Chris Doten, Nick Sera-Leyva
summary: "Next to figuring out your individual Topics, overall session agenda planning is the probably the most important activity you can spend time on before you get into the classroom. Since many events will require trainers to tweak agendas based on unknown or unforeseen circumstances, thoughtful and thorough pre-event preparation will help you make last-minute adjustments, especially if you're prepared for a second set of potential training sessions.

The decisions in the Event Planning process will become input parameters for the Agenda Planning process. Major inputs include:

- Participants (number, diversity, roles and competencies)
- Venue (size, location, facilities)
- Resources available (connectivity, hardware)
- Trainers (number, competencies)
- Communication prior to and during the event

Make sure you allot yourself enough time for crafting an agenda as well the preparation that follows. The more days there are for the workshop, the more prep days you'll need. Each full session generally takes at least 1 day to comfortably finalize: half a day to design, and another half day to source materials, and to prepare presentations and/or lectures. A standard 4-day digital security training with about 6 to 8 individual sessions will require at least 6 to 8 days of preparation for a single trainer - not to mention the time required to incorporate these sessions into a larger overall workshop structure.

Keep in mind that this guide represents advice, input, and experience of the authors. The suggested guidelines below are designed to reduce common mistakes and encourage trainers to design workshops that are fun, safe, and effective. Each trainer has his or her own style and approach, which evolves over time and prioritizes the safety of participants. This is a living document - please send us feedback and suggestions!
