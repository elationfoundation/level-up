title: Planning An Event Agenda
author: Daniel O'Clunaigh, Carol, Ali Ravi, Lindsay Beck, Chris Doten, Nick Sera-Leyva
summary: "Next to figuring out your individual Topics, overall session agenda planning is the probably the most important activity you can spend time on before you get into the classroom. Since many events will require trainers to tweak agendas based on unknown or unforeseen circumstances, thoughtful and thorough pre-event preparation will help you make last-minute adjustments, especially if you're prepared for a second set of potential training sessions."
