summary: "LevelUp’s content has been developed by a group of dedicated digital security trainers that are willingly sharing their knowledge in order to protect individuals working for greater rights and social justice. They also hope to improve their own training skills and content by interacting with other trainers who may modify and adapt the content that is available on this website. Our ask is that if you use the content in anyway, please provide comment and feedback on what you’ve used. We would also love to get new content connected to digital security training - if you have something you’d like to contribute to the site, please follow the instrutions below."

## How to comment on the content

Level Up is using a web annotator called [Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is). You may have noticed the Hypothesis panel on the right side of the Level Up website. You need to create an account in order to comment on and save hightlights on the website.

Check out this tutorial on [how to use the annotator](https://github.com/the-engine-room/level-up/wiki/How-to-Use-Hypothesis).

## How to contribute to localization efforts

We want Level Up to be accessible in many different ways. It is crucial that the content is localized. In an effort to suppor that goal, Level Up is taking advantage of a translation platform called [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) which is free for open source projects. If you would like to translate the content of Level Up, please get in contact with the [site administrator].
