# The "Golden Rules" of Effective Training #

This is a summary of training essentials, based on over a decade of training experience in the field. For more information about specific training techniques, please browse the additional resources throughout this site.

## "Golden Rule" 1 ##
**Always explain why a tool, strategy, or habit is important *before* you start training on it.**

Lessons will stick with participants if they know how the information is relevant to themselves and their work. To facilitate this, trainers may choose to employ one or more of the following approaches:

- Use **real-life** examples or case studies that your participants can relate to.
- Connect the session theme to the work that your participants do on a **daily basis**.
- Get to know your participants' online and communication habits - **relate the training to those.**
- Emphasize that security is as much about **a change in behavior** as it is about the tools.

## "Golden Rule" 2 ##
**Create and foster a *safe and secure* space for your training.**

Agree with the participants to not broadcast identities via social media and on the Internet. As a digital security trainer, do not allow the participants to name you online as such.

The public face of your training should not at any point become a cause for concern. Banners & signage (if even necessary to begin with), visa invitation letters, and even formal emails should not use terms or phrases that could raise red flags in certain settings such as "digital security", "online privacy", "circumvention", etc.

*For more guidance on creating safe spaces for digital security trainings, refer to the **Holistic Security** section of LevelUp.*

## "Golden Rule" 3 ##
**Provide participants with ways to communicate with you securely *post-training.***

If your participants live in high-risk environments where monitoring is prevalent, it's essential to to establish spolicies with organizers that will cover communications before, during and after the workshop.

Most importantly, remember to stick to the following guidelines:



- Do not divulge the list of training participants online, or the names of any individual participants.
- Keep the personal details of the participants (passport numbers, full names, addresses) offline and secure no matter what.
- If possible, either try to include the organizers in discussions about post-training communication with participants, or conduct a separate session specifically to discuss secure communication practices with them.
