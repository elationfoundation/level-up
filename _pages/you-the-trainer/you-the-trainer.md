title: You, The Trainer
author: Nick Sera-Leyva, Carol Waters
summary: "Every trainer is stronger in some areas than others. Some trainers over-focus on the technical details of content and shortshrift everything else, leaving participants bored and confused. Others are amazing at leading activities, but participants come away from the workshop without a very weak understanding of the tools and how they’re designed to make them “safer.” In the worst case scenarios, participants feel alienated from the subject (or the trainer), don’t enjoy themselves, or the workshop makes them more confused than at the start.

The best trainers are constantly improving, and can be near magician-like in their ability to tailor a training to a particular group of participants, know their weak spots, innovate new approaches, and stay up to date on tools and vulnerabilities."
