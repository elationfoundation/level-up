title: "Planning Your Event Agenda | The Agenda Checklist"
author: "Daniel O'Clunaigh, Carol, Ali Ravi, Lindsay Beck, Chris Doten, Nick Sera-Leyva"

summary: "Next to figuring out your individual Topics, overall session agenda planning is the probably the most important activity you can spend time on before you get into the classroom. Since many events will require trainers to tweak agendas based on unknown or unforeseen circumstances, thoughtful and thorough pre-event preparation will help you make last-minute adjustments, especially if you're prepared for a second set of potential training sessions."

***Disclaimer Note to the Reader:***
<br>
Keep in mind that this guide represents advice, input, and experience of the authors. The suggested guidelines below are designed to reduce common mistakes and encourage trainers to design workshops that are fun, safe, and effective. Each trainer has his or her own style and approach, which evolves over time and prioritizes the safety of participants. This is a living document - please send us feedback and suggestions!

## Introduction ##
The decisions in the **Event Planning process [LINK]** will become input parameters for the Agenda Planning process. Major inputs include:

- Participants (number, diversity, roles and competencies)
- Venue (size, location, facilities)
- Resources available (connectivity, hardware)
- Trainers (number, competencies)
- Communication prior to and during the event

**Make sure you allot yourself enough time for crafting an agenda as well the preparation that follows.** The more days there are for the workshop, the more prep days you'll need. Each full session generally takes at least 1 day to comfortably finalize: half a day to design, and another half day to source materials, and to prepare presentations and/or lectures. A standard 4-day digital security training with about 6 to 8 individual sessions will require at least 6 to 8 days of preparation for a single trainer - not to mention the time required to incorporate these sessions into a larger overall workshop structure.

#### Note to Trainers: ####
Before continuing onward with planning your agenda, we strongly recommend...


- *First* referring to the **Planning Your Event [LINK]** resource for guidance on pre-event communication, needs assessment, risk analysis, and logistical preparation.
- *Then* reading through the first part of this guide, **The Participant-Driven Agenda [LINK]**, with guidance and considerations for planning need-responsive agendas.

## Starting from Scratch ##

As detailed in our guide **How To: Preparing Sessions Using ADIDS [LINK]**, its helpful to think of an agenda as a larger image, composed of individual puzzle pieces that are the different sessions, activities, and other components of your event. When considering where to begin when planning the technical **content** of a digital security training or workshop, it helps to think about the overall structure as a set of tiers, ***starting from the very general and  becoming gradually more specific.***

This means beginning with what the overall **context** of the training will be (in this case, Digital Security), gradually honing in next on the required **themes** (or, the **reasons** -- what are participants trying to protect themselves from or improve -- that the event is being gathered) such as "Safer Online Communication" or "Securing Sensitive Data", and then finally arriving upon the individual **topics** that will need to be covered in order to address these.

While technical event content is frequently the easiest place to begin when organizing a comprehensive agenda, there are many other components which must also be planned and prepared.

**To help trainers and facilitators keep track of all these moving pieces**, we've organized an **Agenda Checklist** below that provides:


- **a)** details about the "what" of each of these composite parts, and...
- **b)** links to further resources elsewhere on LevelUp to aid in their planning and preparation (where applicable).

## Agenda Checklist ##


### 1. Opening and Closing Sessions (Daily) ###
Each day should have opening and closing sessions including, for example, an energizer or icebreaker and a go-around of how participants are feeling or what they are thinking at the start/end of the day.

#### Further Resources: ####

- **Icebreakers, Energizers, and Interactive Activities [LINK]** for dynamic activity ideas.
- **First 3 Sessions of Your Event | Sharing Your Story [LINK]** for creative introduction activity ideas.
<br><br>

### 2. Setting Participant Expectations (First Day) ###
This is a 'must' exercise for the first day - this should be an open, facilitated conversation between trainers and participants that reconciles what participants want or expect to learn with what the trainer(s) are capable of delivering given time, expertise, or logistical parameters.

#### Further Resources: ####
- **Setting Expectations for Events [LINK]** offers practical guidance for managing expectations before and during training events.
<br><br>

### 3. Creating Guidelines and "Shared Agreements" (First Day) ###
This is a 'must’ exercise for the first day. Time must always be invested in developing  ground rules, or "shared agreements" before the start of a training event. When working with adults, the facilitator has the great importance of recognizing everyone’s experience, expertise and autonomy. To help establish working agreements as to how the group should best collaborate and work together, you can crowd-source agreements, rather than prescribe them as ground rules.

#### Further Resources: ####

- **The First 3 Sessions of Your Event | Developing Shared Agreements [LINK]** contains strategies for facilitating this discussion effectively.
<br><br>

### 4. Establishing Times and Places (First Day) ###
This is a 'must’ exercise for the first day. Clearly outline the training locations, start and end times, and schedule for group outings or evening hours (if any). These details should be clear throughout the training for participants.
<br><br>

### 5. Session Content (Daily) ###
This includes the training sessions you’ve chosen in order to cover the topics, issues, and skills you’ve identified as priorities.

This is likely to change, particularly after the first day, as you gain a greater sense of the participants in the room and what the most effective sessions will be for them as a group given any wide variations in skills and experiences.

Trainers are likely to begin to adjust the draft agenda (sometimes very substantially) based on the first day, and should budget enough time after the end of the first day to meet up and discuss if and how the agenda should be adjusted.

#### Further Resources: ####
- **Planning Your Event Agenda | The Participant-Driven Agenda [LINK]** for guidance on crafting participatory event agendas and session.
- **How-To: Preparing Sessions Using ADIDS [LINK]** for details on using the ADIDS approach to prepare event sessions.
<br><br>

### 6. Energizers, Icebreakers, and Interactive Activities (Daily) ###
Trainers will want to spread these throughout the training in order to a) “break the ice” among participants in the early days, and b) break up the sessions with fun activities. Trainers are likely to be conservative in their choices of energizers/icebreakers in the early days of the event; after a few days, you’ll know your participants better and know if there’s any type of energizers/icebreakers to avoid due to physical (e.g., high mobility energizers for less-mobile participants) or wellbeing issues (e.g., energizers/icebreakers that involve touching).

#### Further Resources: ####
- **Icebreakers, Energizers, and Interactive Activities [LINK]** for dynamic activity ideas.
<br><br>

### 7. Participant Evaluation of Event (Daily) ###
This might include a **Plusses and Deltas [LINK]** exercise at the end of each day, for participants to indicate what they liked, and what they thought could have improved. Trainers should meet briefly at the end of each day to go over participants’ Plusses and Deltas, tweaking the event and agenda accordingly (within reason) to continually improve the training as it continues. At the beginning of the next day’s training, trainers should take a short period of time to review the plus highlights, and then bring up any deltas that are broadly shared and address them.

#### Further Resources: ####
- **Planning Your Event Agenda | The Participant-Driven Agenda [LINK]** for variations on the "Plusses and Deltas" feedback and evaluation exercise.

## Additional Resources ##

- P2PU has a course full of resources on Designing Collaborative Workshops, many of which come from other organizations like Aspiration Tech, The Ruckus Society, and Seeds for Change.

- Aspiration Tech has a Facilitation Wiki with relevant sections for security workshops.
Seeds for Change has a number of resources, including those focused on facilitation and faciliation tools.

- Although Tactical Technology Collective's Source Camps are a larger type of event than most security workshops, their resources on faciliation and agendas are useful.
