title: Before an Event
author: Nick Sera-Leyva
summary: "When planning digital safety training events and workshops, arguably the most critical phase of the process takes place *before* the event itself. From risk assessments and establishing baselines of participant experience, to operational and logistical safety and planning, the effort put in before an event can have a huge impact on its success.

This section are by no means completely comprehensive - the number of elements which go into event planning can be numerous and complex, especially when physical and psycho-social factors come into play. Nonetheless, the resources included here are all designed to reduce common mistakes and encourage trainers to design workshops that are fun, safe, and effective."
